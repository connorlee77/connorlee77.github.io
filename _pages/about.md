I'm a final-year PhD candidate in the [Autonomous Robotics and Controls Laboratory](https://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/) at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) (Caltech) where I develop computer vision algorithms for robot localization and semantic perception. 

I've also spent time at [Google AR](https://arvr.google.com/) working on motion tracking algorithms for augmented reality devices and at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) where I worked on Siri visual intelligence. 

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra) on the Identity team. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Caltech.
