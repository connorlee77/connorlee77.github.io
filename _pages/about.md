I'm currently at [Google Labs](https://labs.google/) working at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and controls for [Project Starline](https://starline.google/).  

I completed my Ph.D at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), where I specialized in computer vision for robot localization and semantic perception in the [Autonomous Robotics and Controls Laboratory](https://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/). 

I've also spent time at [Google AR](https://arvr.google.com/) (motion tracking for augmented reality devices), at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) (self-supervised learning for Siri Visual Intelligence), and at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra) (identity and secure access). I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Caltech.
